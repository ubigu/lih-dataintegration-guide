Location Innovation Hub - Data Integration Guide

This GitHub page has sample code for using various Python libraries which can be used in data integration.

Using the code examples requires a source for the data used in the code. The user must manually add these sources to the code. The code will not work without these modifications.

Test data can be found for many functions, but in the database code examples, the user must have an existing database under their control in order to use the code effectively.

If user wants to get real existing data for testing there are several sources. National Land Survey of Finland has serveral different datasets available under open data Attribution CC 4.0 license.

For API code testing there are variety of url addresses available for eaxmple from NLS Finland. Some of them requires login and nany of them are under open data Attribution CC 4.0 license.

Remember that when ever using open data Attribution CC 4.0 license there is need to mention the origin of the data if it is published.


There you can find sources for geospatial data [NLS Finland geospatial data](https://asiointi.maanmittauslaitos.fi/karttapaikka/tiedostopalvelu).

And for API here [Using NLS Finland interface](https://www.maanmittauslaitos.fi/en/maps-and-spatial-data/datasets-and-interfaces/general-information-about-interface-services).

**Remember always to read terms of use before using the data and publishing it.**
